							<h1 class="major">Education</h1>
							<p>My highest level of education attained is a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering, having graduated with a <strong>First Class Honors</strong>, which means I may know a thing or two about problem solving and computing in general. I also happen to possess basic computer literacy and troubleshooting skills, which, contrary to popular belief, has absolutely nothing to do with my Computer Science degree! Also, kindly note that requests to fix your computer problems outside of my current (as of December 2021) full-time IT consulting job will only be entertained on a case-by-case basis, with your chance of succeeding being greater than 0 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Material_conditional" target="_blank">only if</a> you happen to run <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/installation-guide/s390x/ch01s03.html" target="_blank">GNU/Linux</a> like I do ;-)</p>
							<p>During my study at HKUST, my academic areas of interest included:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Interactive theorem proving: the use of specialized software tools known as proof assistants to build logical theories and perform logical deductions based on those theories</li>
								<li>Programming languages and type systems: the study of programming languages, their structure and execution semantics, design and implementation, properties of individual programs and programming languages as a whole; design of type systems, properties of type systems and implications</li>
								<li>GNU/Linux: A family of operating systems based on the open source Linux kernel that has come to dominate every corner of the tech industry, from smartphones to servers to datacenters to supercomputers, <em>except</em> the desktop use case. An interesting corollary is that everyone in the tech industry knows about it (or at least its existence thereof), and everyone else doesn't ;-)</li>
							</ul>
							<p>Note however that my interests have evolved since then, with my current interests residing in cloud computing and container orchestration. In fact, I am currently considering the possibility of undertaking an online Master's degree related to cloud computing.</p>
